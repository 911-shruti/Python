# 🐍 Python Learning Repository (with DSA Basics)

Hi! I'm Shruti, and this is my personal repository where I'm actively learning **Python programming** and beginning my journey into **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

---

## 🌱 What's This Repo About?

This repository is a growing collection of my notes, code snippets, and practice problems as I learn Python and slowly explore basic DSA concepts.

Currently, it's focused more on:
- 🔹 Python fundamentals
- 🔹 Syntax, loops, functions, file handling, OOP
- 🔹 Small code experiments and examples

And gradually expanding into:
- 📘 Basic DSA topics like arrays, lists, stacks (just started!)
